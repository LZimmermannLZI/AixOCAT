# AixOCAT - Library framework for building automation systems based on the OSCAT libraries

[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](http://doge.mit-license.org) [![VM TcUnit-Runner](https://github.com/LZimmermannLZI/AixOCAT/actions/workflows/VM_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LZimmermannLZI/AixOCAT/actions/RUN_ID)

AixOCAT is an open source software library for the implementation of control algorithms in building automation systems and test benches and is based on the [OSCAT](http://www.oscat.de/) libraries.

As the library framework is developed at the [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute
for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1), the library's name AixOCAT is derived from the city's French 
name Aix-la-Chapelle, which the people of Aachen are very fond of and use a lot. 
With the name AixOCAT we follow this local tradition.

AixOCAT features support for different software tools, that can be used for the implementation of control algorithms, as well as support for various commonly used communication/signal transmission interfaces.

This GitHub page will be used to further develop the package and make it
available under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixOCAT/blob/master/LICENSE).
